The objective of this mini-project is the creation of three supervised classification models, by applying the principles of automatic learning 
(machine learning) on a data set (Data Set).
The creation of a classification model is a process involving a set of steps, namely: understanding the data (data understanding), data preparation, 
creation and validation of models and finally the use of the model.By carrying out this mini-project, we will put into practice all the theoretical principles
of this process using the Python language and its ecosystem (set of packages) dedicated to data science and machine learning.
